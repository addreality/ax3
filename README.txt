1) parse parsetree into
2) build structure
  a list of modules, each of whose contains:
   - imports
   - main decl
     * class/interface with function signatures
	 * function with its signature
	 * var with type?
   - module-local decls
3) load extern libs with signatures into the structure
4) type the function bodies and var init expressions
5) transform typed tree into a more haxe-friendly one
 - rewrite for
 - rewrite for...in
 - rewrite for..each
 - rewrite implicit to-bool coercion
 - rewrite potentially-undefined-to-basic-type coercion
 - rewrite E4X operators
 - rewrite module-level functions/vars into classes with statics
 - rewrite "untyped" field access to getProperty
6) output Haxe files


TODO:
 - splice
 - E4X
 - super() calls for autogenerated ctors for classes with parent ctors
 - fix @haxe-type path (check if it's imported and use full path if not)
 - redundant semicolon after non-printed exprs in the block
 - hasOwnProperty for dicts (and dict API in general)
 - arithmetic binop type coercion
 - block-level && chains
 - flash native @:getter @:setter for overloaded accessors
 - inline `static const` for literals
